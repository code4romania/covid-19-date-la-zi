## Contributing

This project is built by amazing volunteers and you can be one of them! Here's a list of ways in [which you can contribute to this project](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

If you plan on contributing code to the project, it's very important to read the [Collaboration Workflow](.github/WORKFLOW.md) we use at Code 4 Romania.
It's very important to create your own fork, push code to branches into your fork, then creating PRs that go into the original project's `develop` branch.
It's all very detailed in the link above.

## Overview

The project's most interesting data is found in the `dashboard` page. It gets the information from the API
in form of a JSON response, then parses it and groups it into several objects that are passed to
individual cards who in turn display certain charts depending on the provided data.

We use the react wrapper for [echartsjs](https://www.echartsjs.com/examples/en/index.html) -
[echarts-for-react](https://github.com/hustcc/echarts-for-react)
and [Bulma](https://bulma.io) for stylesheets.

The information displayed in this app is provided directly by the Ministry Of Health.
